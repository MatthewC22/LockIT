# PRJ566-Passwords-Group-Project

#### Password Manager for Desktop and Mobile

Our groups project is to build a Password Manager that runs as a native Python application on either desktop and on your mobile device (cross-platform). 
This app will use the AES 256 encryption standard to encrypt data.

You can install the latest version of Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

# Ideas for tools to be used for project:

### Desktop version

[PyQt](https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial) - A Python GUI Framework

[TKInter](https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial) - Pythons standard GUI

[PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) - Program to make Python code into an application
