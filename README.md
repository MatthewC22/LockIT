# PRJ566-Passwords-Group-Project

#### Password Manager for Desktop and Mobile

Our groups project is to build a Password Manager that runs as a native Python application on either desktop or on your mobile device (cross-platform). 
This app will use the AES 256 encryption standard to encrypt data.
