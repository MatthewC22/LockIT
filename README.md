# LockIt Password Manager

#### Password Manager for Desktop 

Our groups project is to build a Password Manager that runs as a Python application on desktop.

This app will use the AES 256 encryption standard to encrypt data.

You can install the latest version of Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

# Ideas for tools to be used for project:

[TKInter](https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial) - Pythons standard GUI
